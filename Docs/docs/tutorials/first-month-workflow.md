# Tutorial: First Month Workflow

This tutorial walks you through the basic workflow of using **MyMoney** for your first month—from setting up a budget, to tracking accounts and transactions, to reviewing reports.

## 1. Create Your Budget

MyMoney uses a [zero-based budgeting system](../tutorials/zero-based-budgeting.md), which means every dollar you earn should be assigned a purpose. By the end, **income – expenses = 0**.

1. Go to the **Budget** page and click **New Budget**.  
2. Select the current month, then click **OK**.  
3. Add your income categories:  
   - Click the **+** beside *Income*.  
   - Enter a category name (e.g., “Salary”), the expected amount, then click **OK**.  
   - Repeat for each source of income.  
4. Add your expenses:  
   - First, create a group (e.g., *Housing*, *Transportation*) by clicking the **+** beside *Expenses*.  
   - Within each group, click **Add Item**, enter a category name and planned amount, then click **OK**.  
   - Repeat for all expenses.  
5. Add savings categories:  
   - Click the **+** beside *Savings*.  
   - These categories function like [sinking funds](sinking-fund.md) for long-term goals.  

**Tip:** Watch the “Amount left to budget” at the top. Adjust income/expenses until it reaches **$0.00**.  

To make changes later:  
- Right-click a category to **Edit** or **Delete** it.  
- For expense groups, use the **Edit** or **Delete** buttons at the top of the group.

## 2. Add Your Accounts

Accounts help you track where your money actually is.  

1. Go to the **Accounts** page and click **New Account**.  
2. Enter the account name and current balance, then click **OK**.  
3. Repeat for all bank accounts, credit cards, or cash balances.  

Managing accounts:  
- Rename: Right-click an account → **Rename**.  
- Update balance: Right-click → **Update balance**.  
- Delete: Right-click → **Delete** (**cannot be undone**).

## 3. Record Transactions

Transactions connect your real-world spending to your budget.  

1. On the **Accounts** page, click **New Transaction**.  
2. Choose **Income** or **Expense**.  
3. Enter the amount, date, and payee.  
4. Assign the transaction to the correct category.  
5. Select the account (defaults to the one you’re viewing).  
6. (Optional) Add a memo.  
7. Click **OK**.  

To edit or delete later: right-click the transaction and choose **Edit** or **Delete**.

## 4. Transfer Money Between Accounts

To move money from one account to another:  

1. On the **Accounts** page, click **Transfer**.  
2. Select the “from” and “to” accounts.  
3. Enter the transfer amount.  
4. Click **OK**.  

This automatically creates matching transactions in both accounts.

## 5. Review Reports

Reports show how your plan compares to reality.  

- **Dashboard**:  
    - Budget report (Planned vs. Actual vs. Remaining).  
    - Income vs. Expenses chart for the current month.
- **Budget Reports**:  
    - View past months’ budgets.  
- **Charts**:  
    - Income vs. Expense chart (last 12 months).  
    - Net worth chart (time period selectable).

## 6. Move to the Next Month

When a new month begins:  

1. Create a new budget.  
2. In the dialog, check **Start with previous month’s budget**.  

This copies your categories forward and carries over balances in your savings funds.

That’s it! With your first month complete, you’ll now have a clear picture of your income, spending, and savings.
