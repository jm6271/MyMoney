# Tutorial: Using Sinking Funds

## What Is a Sinking Fund?

A sinking fund is a way of setting aside money for future expenses by saving 
a little at a time. Instead of scrambling to find the full amount when the bill 
comes due, you break it into smaller, manageable contributions spread over weeks 
or months.

Think of it as a dedicated mini-savings account for specific goals or irregular 
expenses. Common examples include:

- Annual insurance premiums
- Holiday gifts
- Car repairs or maintenance
- Vacation savings

By using sinking funds, you avoid debt and reduce stress because the money is 
already waiting when the expense arrives.

## How Do Sinking Funds Work?

The idea is simple:

- Identify the expense (e.g., $600 for car insurance due in 6 months).
- Divide the cost by the time available ($600 ÷ 6 months = $100 per month).
- Save regularly by setting aside that amount each month.
- When the bill is due, you already have the full $600 saved.

Instead of one big hit to your budget, you spread it evenly over time.

## Setting Up a Sinking Fund in your MyMoney budget

### Step 1: Create the Fund

1. Go to your budget and click the **+** button beside "Savings".
2. Give your fund a descriptive name (e.g., “Car Insurance,” “Holiday Gifts”).
3. Enter the amount you will save this month in the "Planned" field.
4. Enter the amount you already have in the "Current Balance" field.

The planned amount will be treated as an expense in the budget, automatically
decreasing the "Left to Budget" value and showing up on the "Expenses" pie chart.

The balance of the fund will automatically increment to include your contribution
from this month.

### Step 2: Use the Fund

1. When the expense comes due, record the payment from the sinking fund instead of 
   your main budget categories.

2. The app will subtract the expense from the balance of that fund, keeping your 
   regular budget on track.

## Tips for Using Sinking Funds Effectively

- Start with just a few priority funds (like car repairs or annual bills).
- Review your funds monthly and adjust amounts if needed.
- Once you reach your goal, keep the fund active — just reset the target and due date 
  for the next cycle.
- Manually adjust the balance if necessary by right-clicking on the fund in the budget
  and selecting "Edit"

**Result:** With sinking funds, you’ll always be prepared for irregular expenses without derailing your budget.
